Qt project to run a simulator of a Microcurrent Technology (MCT) device similar to the Denas or Avazzia.

Instructions:
-Load the project (COMP3004-DenasApp.pro) in Qt Creator, and compile/run.

Code Description:

We simulate the device (represented by [mainwindow.cpp]), along with its battery (battery.cpp), and the waveform (waveform.cpp) that it produces. A simulator control (SimulatorControl.cpp) addresses issues specific to the overall simulation rather than just the device itself;  e.g. it allows you to recharge the battery, and apply the device to the skin.
